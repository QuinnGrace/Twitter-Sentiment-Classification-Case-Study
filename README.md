# Twitter Case Study: Using Natural Language Processing to Classify Tweet Sentiments Towards Climate Change

NOTE: Due to the nature of this project, code cannot be shared publicly. 

## Context 
Amidst a seemingly growing skepticism towards climate change, companies that market themselves as 'green' or offer products that reduce their customers' environmental impact are in a precarious position if they do not do adequate market research. To add to current market research efforts, a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data must be created.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify trends in Tweets
- Create a model that can classify climate change sentiment
- Build an app that allows for user-friendly usage of the model
- Present findings to stakeholders

## Tools Used
- Python
  - Streamlit
  - scikit-learn
  - nltk
- Comet
- GitHub
- AWS EC2

## Output

An SVC model with an F1-score (accuracy) of 0.76105. This placed us 15th out of 293 teams in the Kaggle leaderboard.

## Conclusions
- The vast majority of Tweets are in support of climate change.
- There is little difference between the words used by people who believe in climate change and those who do not. This may be because many people are trying to talk about trending topics and hashtags, so the most frequent words over a large timespan would be the same. 

## Recommendations
- For more support on Twitter and retweets, a company should market towards people who believe in climate change since most of the Tweets are generated by them.
- A tool should be created to automatically differentiate words used by those who believe in climate change and those who do not based on current trends since the differences appear to be trend-dependant but are lost over larger periods of time. This would allow marketers to identify key terms to use to target their target market.
