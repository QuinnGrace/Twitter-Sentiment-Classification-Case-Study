# Twitter Case Study: Using Natural Language Processing to Classify Tweet Sentiments Towards Climate Change

NOTE: Due to the nature of this project, code cannot be shared publicly. 

## Context 
Amidst a seemingly growing skepticism towards climate change, companies that market themselves as 'green' or offer products that reduce their customers' environmental impact are in a precarious position if they do not do adequate market research. To add to current market research efforts, a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data must be created.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify trends in Tweets
- Create a model that can classify climate change sentiment
- Build an app that allows for user-friendly usage of the model
- Present findings to stakeholders

## Tools Used
- Python
  - Streamlit
  - scikit-learn
  - nltk
- Comet

## Output

An SVC model with an F1-score (accuracy) of 0.76105. This placed us 15th out of 293 teams in the Kaggle leaderboard.
